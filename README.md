This system is made by using java (AWT), MySQL, and SQL queries. In this system, first user registered by name, email,  username, and password and this information is save into the database. Then the user can log in, if anybody wants to register with the same mail id then it can't be possible. After this user has to enter the correct username and password to log in.
